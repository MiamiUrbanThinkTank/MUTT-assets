## General design and development specification

### The technology "stack"

The "stack" is the list of systems that are used to make your website work. I list them here going from the "lowest level" to the "highest level". Low level systems form the foundation. They are generally not so customizable, because they take a long time to make. The high level systems are easily customizable, and usually have more to do with the front-end, or things the user sees thank with the back end, for example the server.

* Version control
	* Git - Git is a version control software that allows us to link our server to a web service for managing Git projects. That sounds really complicated. And I can explain it in person as well. Our server is going to use git to keep our development files current and allow us to have the most control over our development environment.
	* Github - Github is the web service which is hosting our on line repository which contains our source code. Here on Github I am also hosting this assets repository, meant to create a place to guide the development of the site.
* Web Host
	- [Siteground](http://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=af67d756d15d1e67907ce65f3bbe8e03&utm_expid=339965-8.yOg9KVp7QF2SGE_wdchlCw.0&utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wpbeginner.com%2Fwordpress-hosting%2F) looks like the best choice of web host for MUTT. They seem to be very affordable with great speeds, great reviews, and good customer service.
* Wordpress
	* Wordpress - a php based blogging framework. For this website, I am going to install to a server a "vanilla" version of wordpress, migrate your existing blog posts and data in to the new wordpress install, and then modify the wordpres theme and setup so that is is functional and visually appealing to your tastes. 
	* Plugins
		- Social media plugin
		- Plugins to support media formats
	* Transferring posts should be simple. And it won't be destructive, either, as your blogger data will perist on Google's servers.
* Design and Themes
	* Twitter Bootstrap for front end framework
	* Deep customizations to the base theme, to the point of having a new, unique theme
